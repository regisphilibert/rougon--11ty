This is a simple open source website about [Les Rougon-Macquart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Rougon-Macquart) by [Emile Zola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Zola) built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and Pug.js.

This well known french literature saga holds 20 books and more than a thousand characters.

Copying/pasting their bios in a WordPress before my coding days was kind of a lengthy hobby, but I ended with the perfect project to tryout new stuff!

After WordPress AngularJS, [Hugo](https://github.com/regisphilibert/rougon) and[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), this repo is an [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/) port or Les Rougon-Macquart.com
